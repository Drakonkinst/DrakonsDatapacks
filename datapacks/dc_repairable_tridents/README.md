# Repairable Tridents

**Repairable Tridents** allows Tridents to be repaired using **Prismarine Shards** on an anvil!

Unlike normal anvil recipes, you must instead throw the items **on top of the anvil** rather than use the anvil GUI. This still requires **1 level per Prismarine Shard used**, which is consumed from the nearest player, but does not utilize or affect anvil work penalties.
