# Umbrella

> **Note**: *This datapack is part of the [Playable Classes](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/wiki/Playable-Classes) collection.*

**Umbrella** adds a customizable and holdable **umbrella** which protects various playable classes such as the **[Enderman](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_enderman)** or **[Vampire](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_vampire)** from the harmful effects of sunlight or rain. It does not have any effect for normal players.

While holding the Umbrella (appearing as an Enchanted Stick) in your mainhand or offhand, an umbrella appears over your head. This umbrella only works when you are moving slowly: **sprinting or swimming** disables the umbrella!

## Crafting

Umbrellas can be crafted with a Carpet of any color, a Diamond, and a Stick. The color of the Carpet used is automatically applied to the Umbrella.

## Customization

The umbrella's color can be customized by using the `/trigger umbrella` command, which displays a menu of colors. This requires you to hold the corresponding dye of your choice in your mainhand, and consumes the dye to apply the color.
