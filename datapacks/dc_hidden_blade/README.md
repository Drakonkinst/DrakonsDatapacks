# Hidden Blade

> *An ancient weapon of a bygone era, honed to deadly perfection. Deals more damage when in stealth or swooping in from above.*
>
> *Nothing is true, everything is permitted.*

**Hidden Blade** adds the signature weapon of *[Assassin's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed)* to the game.

Although it deals the damage of a **Wooden Sword** by default, the blade's damage **massively increases** based on the circumstance. This weapon rewards intelligent setups and precision strikes with the ability to **kill nearby any mob** in one hit.

An unenchanted Hidden Blade deals up to **51 damage** (more than 2.5x of a player's full health bar) based on the following factors:

* **4** base damage
* **+6** damage when sneaking for 5+ seconds
* **+6** damage for every 5 blocks you have fallen, up to 20 blocks for a maximum of **+24** damage. Lasts for up to 1 second after hitting the ground.
* **+50%** critical hit bonus for striking while falling (Vanilla)

Achieving maximum damage is extremely tricky, as players must land a precise strike while slowed and falling a great distance from above. Combine with **Feather Falling**, **Hay Bales**, **Water**, or other cushioning blocks to mitigate fall damage. You can also **enchant** the Hidden Blade to deal even more damage!

Pair with **[Throwable Bombs](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_throwable_potato)** to escape the scene with Smoke Bombs, or try out the **[Assassin Versus Hunters](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_manhunt_assassin)** gamemode to have a manhunt!

This item is currently obtainable **only to server operators**, by running `/function dc_hidden_blade:give`. In addition, the **Book of Assassins** serves as a guidebook on how to use the Blade and can be given with `/function dc_hidden_blade:give_assassin_book`.
