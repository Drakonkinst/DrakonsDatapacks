Most striking is their glowing armor\\u2014how they came to possess such magic is beyond me. Perhaps it\\u2019s a blessing from Agni.\"}","{\"text\":\"Despite their inferior armaments, even our best knights have trouble fighting these creatures. They are astoundingly mobile\\u2014I could swear that at times they moved faster than the eye could track. I tremble at the thought of facing more than one at once.\"}","{\"text\":\"They tend to stay above ground, but as I learned on the trek to Afthonia, can catch your scent from a very long distance. They are relentless hunters, and seem more adept than most of the shambling dead at catching their opponent unawares.\"}","{\"text\":\"Finally, while observing skirmishes I have occasionally witnessed some unseen force shoving our combatants into the Shiny Toe\\u2019s reach. How this is accomplished is entirely a mystery, much like the creature itself.\"}","{\"text\":\"One thing we do know with absolute certainty\\u2014they came from the north.\"}"],title:"ยง5Research Log 22",author:"Bavel, the Eclipsed",generation:3}]
