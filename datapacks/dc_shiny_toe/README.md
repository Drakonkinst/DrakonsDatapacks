# Shiny Toes

> *"The latest horror of the undead, known as Shiny Toes, remains largely unknown to my order. The survivors among us seem familiar with this sort of creature, but they do not share their knowledge easily. What little we have learned is detailed here.*
>
> *It is clear that Shiny Toes are far quicker, stronger, and more durable than the average zombie. Most striking is their glowing armor—how they came to possess such magic is beyond me. Perhaps it’s a blessing from Agni.*
>
> *Despite their inferior armaments, even our best knights have trouble fighting these creatures. They are astoundingly mobile—I could swear that at times they moved faster than the eye could track. I tremble at the thought of facing more than one at once.*
>
> *They tend to stay above ground, but as I learned on the trek to Afthonia, can catch your scent from a very long distance. They are relentless hunters, and seem more adept than most of the shambling dead at catching their opponent unawares.*
>
> *Finally, while observing skirmishes I have occasionally witnessed some unseen force shoving our combatants into the Shiny Toe’s reach. How this is accomplished is entirely a mystery, much like the creature itself.*
>
> *One thing we do know with absolute certainty—they came from the north."*

**Shiny Toes** add a new mini-boss to the game, the **Shiny Toe**. Remnants of the [Horde](https://wiki.shotbow.net/MineZ_Mobs) from days long past, Shiny Toes—named for their gleaming golden boots—appear similar to Zombies. However, they are stronger in almost every respect, and also have enhanced abilities that make them a dangerous threat to any traveler. They have a 2% chance to spawn in place of a normal Zombie.

To the unprepared, Shiny Toes can be lethal adversaries. The best option is to snipe it away with your bow; otherwise, engaging in melee combat can be dangerous even with good armor due to its evasive dashes. It is incredibly difficult to hide or flee from Shiny Toes, since they can grapple you from a distance—therefore, it is recommended to focus on dealing damage to the Shiny Toe and slaying it as quickly as possible.
