# Speed Paths

**Speed Paths** is a simple datapack that makes **players and their mounts move faster on Dirt Paths!**

While on a Dirt Path, you and any mounts you ride move 30% faster (slightly faster than sprint-jumping). This **stacks multiplicatively with other speed buffs**, allowing even faster movement with potions and other effects!

If you would like to use Dirt Paths without the speed bonus, place **Cobblestone** beneath the Dirt Path block to disable the effect.
