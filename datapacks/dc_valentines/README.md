With this datapack, killing **hostile mobs** with a ranged attack (Bow, Trident, etc.) has a 10% chance to give you a collectible decorative **Heart Capsule**. In addition, non-Infinity arrows shot from any source have a 10% chance to turn into a **Valentine Arrow**, dealing no damage and applying Regeneration II for 10 seconds.
