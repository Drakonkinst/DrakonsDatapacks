**Long Fall Boots** adds the *[Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series))* series' famed footwear, the **Long Fall Boots**, to the game. As advertised in [Aperture Investment Opportunity #4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX9Sc88qreg), Long Fall Boots protect their user (and their portal device) from fall damage **at any height**. With these equipped, you can heedlessly jump off tall ledges without fear for your safety.

As you fall, a rushing wind sound (and a resounding *clang* upon landing) will confirm your Long Fall Boots' effectiveness. Note that the Long Fall Boots **do not provide any armor**, though they come enchanted with Mending and can be further enchanted with an Anvil.

Long Fall Boots can be crafted with the following recipe. In-game, Long Fall Boots appear as white-dyed leather boots with a special Netherite trim.

## Known Bugs

* While falling, taking damage (especially under damage-over-time effects like Poison or Wither) may send you flying into the air. However, rest assured that the Long Fall Boots will protect you either way, even if your trip down is longer than anticipated.
