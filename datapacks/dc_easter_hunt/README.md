# Easter Egg Hunt

**Easter Egg Hunt** introduces an Easter-themed holiday event where you can collect **Easter Eggs**!

Various activities now have a small chance to drop **Easter Eggs**. There are **210 unique Easter Eggs** to collect, with various **rarities**!

Activities that drop Easter Eggs include:

* Mining
* Building
* Fishing
* Breeding Animals
* Slaying Mobs
* Taming Animals
* Eating
* Trading

In addition, killing **boss mobs** (such as the Wither) are guaranteed to drop **4 eggs**, one of which is always of the highest rarity!

Drop rates are balanced to be somewhat low between all activities, so **play how you want** and the Easter Eggs will appear! Each Easter Egg has a unique pattern, name, and number, which can be used to decorate your home.

When paired with **[Wishing Well](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_wishing_well)**, these eggs can also be broken in water for loot!

> **Warning**: Easter Eggs lose their NBT when placed, and will no longer retain their name, lore, or ability to be opened for loot.
