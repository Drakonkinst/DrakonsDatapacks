# Pet Transfer

**Pet Transfer** adds a system to **transfer pet ownership** between multiple players on a server!

To begin, both the player gifting the pet and the player receiving the pet should run `/trigger pettransfer` to obtain a Pet Transfer book. This book provides clickable links which can be used to transfer nearby pets.

To transfer pets, perform the following steps:

* The player gifting the pets should gather the pets they want to transfer away from their other pets.
* The player receiving pets should click **Accept Pets** to accept the next incoming pet transfer.
* The player gifting the pets should click **Give Pets** to give **all pets they own within 5 blocks** to the receiving player.
* At any time, the player receiving pets may click **Cancel Transaction** to cancel the transfer.

This transfers pet ownership without untaming the pet. Use this on multiplayer servers to run pet shops, or share a surplus of pets with a friend!
