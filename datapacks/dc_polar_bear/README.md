# Improved Polar Bears

**Improved Polar Bears** brings a much-needed overhaul to the Polar Bear! Once a relatively weak and forgotten mob, Polar Bears have clawed their way back to the forefront of the Arctic ecosystem. New **AI behaviors** and interesting mechanics help the Polar Bear live up to their real-life counterparts as the majestic apex predator of the Arctic.

Polar Bears are now considered **hostile** mobs, and not just to players either—they'll attack **nearly any mob** they can get their paws on! However, they only become aggressive towards those that **stray too close**: keep a **respectful distance** from the Polar Bear and it'll leave you alone—saving you the trouble of becoming its early lunch.

Polar Bears actively **hunt fish and other sea creatures**, using its new **Lunge** ability to dash short distances over land and even **underwater** to catch their prey. Adept at navigating icy terrain, Polar Bears can hold their breath for long periods of time and will also **break through thin layers of ice** to open a path to their prey or return to the surface. Be careful: Polar Bears will **prioritize nearby threats**, including you and most hostile mobs, so it's probably best to leave them alone while they hunt.

A Polar Bear's favorite food (in Minecraft, at least) is **Salmon**: If it gets ahold of some, it'll pause for a few moments to **enjoy a snack**! They won't become aggressive while eating, providing an opportunity to **distract them** and pass through safely. If it's already aggressive or you interrupt its meal, however, Salmon **won't save you**.

In addition, the Polar Bear's wintry adaptations allow it to build up extra endurance to survive the wild. For every **Salmon** it eats, it **stores excess energy** which it can later burn to **regenerate health over time**! They can store up to 6 Salmon's worth of food, which is enough to heal them fully over the course of approximately a minute.

Once they've eaten at least 6 Salmon, Polar Bears will automatically **mate** with nearby Polar Bears who are similarly well-fed to give birth to **Polar Bear Cubs**! Like other mobs, Polar Bears can only breed once every 5 minutes. Cubs take 20 minutes to grow up, which cannot be sped up in any way. Note that Polar Bears are still **extra protective** of their cubs—if you go near their child, not even the prospect of food will distract them.

With **far more powerful** stats than before, an encounter with a Polar Bear is no trifling matter even for the strongest players. Its **massive size** makes it impossible to push around, and its **crushing blows** are powerful enough to render Shields useless. Polar Bears put their **enhanced swimming speed** and **Lunge** ability to good use in combat, staying on top of their victims. True to their real-world counterparts, the best strategy when dealing with a Polar Bear is to stay **far, far away**.

Instead of fish, Polar Bears now drop their own **Polar Bear Meat**. This meat is **incredibly poisonous** if eaten raw, but can be eaten safely if cooked.
