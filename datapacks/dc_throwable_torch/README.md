# Throwable Torches

**Throwable Torches** allows thrown torches to **place themselves on the block they land on**. Toss a single torch (default key Q) and have it fall a certain distance to enable this effect. This will not work if the stack contains multiple torches or if it was not thrown far enough.

Throwable torches can be very useful for illuminating environments below you, like ravines! This mechanic also works with Dispensers and Droppers, as well as other means of throwing items. For added immersion, use dynamic lighting mods like [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) or [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)!
