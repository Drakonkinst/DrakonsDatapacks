# Sniffer Riding

**Sniffer Riding** adds a new mechanics to Sniffers, making them **rideable flying mounts** that you can use to adventure across the skies. With this datapack, Sniffers become excellent all-terrain vehicles that can soar over any environment.

To make a Sniffer rideable, throw a **Saddle** towards it. It consumes the item once successful. Sniffer mounts are permanently **immune to fall damage**.

**Press and release Sneak (Left Shift)** while not touching solid ground (midair, in water, or jumping) to mount a nearby Sniffer. When riding, the Sniffer begins to **fly** and can take to the skies. There are three possible controls:

* Look **directly upwards** to make the Sniffer go up.
* Look **directly downwards** to make the Sniffer go down.
* Look anywhere else to make the Sniffer move in your facing direction.

The Sniffer's speed can be one of three levels:

* The Sniffer **trots** at a slow pace when nothing special is being held in either hand.
* Hold its favorite food, **Torchflower Seeds**, in either hand to make the Sniffer begin **walking** at a faster pace.
* Feed it **Torchflower Seeds** by **right-clicking** with that item in hand to make the Sniffer **sprint** for 30 seconds, greatly increasing their speed.
