# Christmas Horde

**Christmas Horde** brings a new aura of festivity to the undead Horde, perfect for the winter holidays!

**Zombies**, **Skeletons**, **Strays**, **Husks**, **Drowned**, and **Wither Skeletons** have a 25% chance to spawn with a **Christmas Hat**! These festive mobs have a 25% chance to drop their hat (unfortunately, still attached to their head) when killed. Collect all 6 unique Christmas heads!

Watch out: these Christmas hats also protect these mobs from burning in the daylight! The Christmas Wither Skeleton head **cannot** be used to summon a Wither, but it would look great over a cozy fireplace.
