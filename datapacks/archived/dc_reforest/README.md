# Reforestation

**Reforestation** is a simple datapack that helps forests naturally regrow. Dropped saplings automatically replant themselves on the ground after a short delay. Replanting will fail if there is already a block, if the sapling is not on plantable ground, or if there is more than one sapling in the stack.
