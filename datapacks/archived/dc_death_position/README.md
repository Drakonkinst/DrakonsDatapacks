# Death Position

**Death Position** adds a simple feature to aid you in recovering lost items. Upon death, your **coordinates and dimension** are printed to you (and only you) in chat.

Note this has a gameplay overlap with the **Recovery Compass**. This feature provides precise coordinates that are lost if chat is cleared in any way (unless you write them down), while the Recovery Compass lasts until the player's next death but only provides direction.
