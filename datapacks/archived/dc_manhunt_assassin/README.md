# Assassin Versus Hunters

**Assassin Versus Hunters** is an add-on for the **[Manhunt](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_manhunt_compass)** datapack that turns the speedrunner into a powerful Assassin! The Assassin runs around on a premade custom map (not included) with a Hidden Blade, and can refill their supplies of Throwable Bombs at supply caches.

Designed to be combined with the following datapacks:

* [Manhunt](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_manhunt_compass)
* [Hidden Blade](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_hidden_blade)
* [Throwable Bombs](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_throwable_bombs)
