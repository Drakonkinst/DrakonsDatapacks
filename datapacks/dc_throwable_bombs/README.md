# Throwable Bombs

**Throwable Bombs** turns certain **Firework Stars** into dangerous tools. When the right Firework Star is thrown as a single item (stacks are ignored), it begins hissing and triggers its effect upon hitting a block. However, they fizzle out and stop functioning in water.

The type of bomb is determined by the explosion type of the Firework Star. All bomb types have a shapeless crafting recipe, consisting of:

* Gunpowder.
* Glowstone Dust. This will apply the "Twinkle" effect, which is required for a Firework Star to turn into a Throwable Bomb.
* At least one dye of choice. (The color, amount of dyes, and amount of gunpowder used to create the Star do not affect the bomb type.)
* Optionally, a special ingredient (see below) to determine the bomb type. If no type is given, it defaults to a **Smoke Bomb**.

Admins may enable or disable any specific bomb types through the `/trigger config` command.

## Bomb Types

### Smoke Bombs

Upon impact, gives all players within the radius Blindness and emits a **smoke screen** for 5 seconds that obscures vision. Only the players within immediate radius upon impact are given Blindness, so players (including the thrower) can enter the smoke screen afterwards without being blinded. In addition, the Smoke Bomb can be conserved if picked up before the smoke screen duration ends. Craft using **no item** (Small Ball Explosion) as the special ingredient.

### Fire Bombs

Upon impact, sets nearby blocks on fire. Craft using a **Fire Charge** (Large Ball Explosion) as the special ingredient.

### Redstone Bombs

Upon impact, **fries Redstone circuitry** by breaking Redstone Dust, Redstone Torches, Redstone Repeaters, and Redstone Comparators in a small area. For example, this can be used to disable Redstone traps, or open Redstone Doors. Craft with a **Gold Nugget** (Star-Shaped Explosion) as the special ingredient.

### Blast Bombs

Upon impact, creates a **high knockback** explosion that does not damage mobs or the environment, which can be useful for displacement or traversal. Craft using a **Feather** (Burst Explosion) as the special ingredient.

### Explosive Bombs

**Explodes** on impact. Craft using any **player or mob head** (Creeper-Shaped Explosion) as the special ingredient.
