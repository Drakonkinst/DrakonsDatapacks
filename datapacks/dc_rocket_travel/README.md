# Rocket Travel

**Rocket Travel** is a work-in-progress datapack that provides fast travel between different locations. Instead of simple teleportation, however, Rocket Travel provides a more immersive approach: blast up into the sky with a powerful rocket engine, and land somewhere entirely different!

Currently, admins must manually set up Rocket Travel locations. In the future, this datapack will allow survival mode players to set up Rocket Launchpads and Launchpad Terminals. This will likely be expensive and designed for late game, with costs similar to a Beacon.
