# Villager Fix

**Villager Fix** prevents players re-rolling Villager trades once the Villager has selected a profession, which can be an extremely broken method of obtaining rare enchanted books and other items at no cost. When a Villager chooses a profession, it now gains a small amount of XP to lock its profession and trades. Removing its work block prevents the Villager from restocking, but does not remove their profession.

This datapack helps prevent easy access to high level enchants and encourages other approaches to enchanting gear, making for a healthier gameplay balance when combined with other datapacks and mods.
