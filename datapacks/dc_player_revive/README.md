# Player Revive

**Player Revive**  is a mechanic that allows players to **revive other dead players** before they respawn. When a player dies, they leave behind a **gravestone**. Living players can stand near this gravestone to begin reviving the fallen player, which takes approximately 15 seconds. Once the revive finishes, the revived player is instantly transported back to their death location upon respawning.

If the fallen player respawns too early or players move away from the grave, the revive is cancelled. The revive process can be **accelerated** if multiple players stand near the grave.

This datapack is **not usable in singleplayer**, since it relies on other players being nearby. However, groups of adventurers will find it extremely useful when far away from home and can avoid cutting their journey short.
