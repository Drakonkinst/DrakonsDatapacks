# Mob Eating

**Mob Eating** allows players to **heal** various creatures without needing to use potions. When fed their **favorite food** while not at full health, the animal will **heal instead**. This matches the behavior of existing animals like Wolves and Cats which the player can already heal with food.

The following mobs can be healed:

* Pigs
* Cows
* Mooshrooms
* Goats
* Sheep
* Chicken
* Axolotls
* Rabbits
* Turtles
* Pandas
* Foxes
* Bees
* Striders
* Hoglins
* Frogs
* Camels
* Sniffers
