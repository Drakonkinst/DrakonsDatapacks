# Universal Dyeing

**Universal Dyeing** is a modified version of [VanillaTweak's](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/) edition which adds the ability to re-dye or un-dye certain items that cannot be re-dyed in vanilla.

Using this datapack, Concrete Powder, Concrete, Glass, and Glass Panes can be re-dyed by surrounding a dye with 8 of that block (any color) on a Crafting Table. In addition, Glass and Glass Panes can be un-dyed by using an Ice Block in place of the dye, washing off the stained color and returning it to its normal state.
