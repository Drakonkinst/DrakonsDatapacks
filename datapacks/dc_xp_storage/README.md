# Ender Chest XP Storage

**Ender Chest XP Storage** allows players to use **Ender Chests to store Experience, which is not lost upon death**.

To deposit XP, stand on top of an Ender Chest to deposit 1 level per second. Sneak to deposit more quickly.

To withdraw XP, stand in front of an Ender Chest (as if you were walking into it) to begin withdrawing XP rapidly. Sneak or step away to pause withdrawing.

These transactions are lossless, which means you can transfer Experience back and forth at will without losing any. Like Ender Chest items, your stored Experience can be accessed from any Ender Chest!

This feature allows Experience to more easily be accumulated over time. In addition, this can make enchanting more efficient since the [higher the Experience Level, the more Experience is consumed](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Experience#Leveling_up).
