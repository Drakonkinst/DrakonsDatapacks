**Mob Studying** allows you to **study** mobs looking at a mob with a **Spyglass** while **sneaking**! Studying the mob for an extended period reveals **information** about them, which varies depending on the mob!

For example, studying a mob reveals its **variant** if it has one (such as for Pandas, Tropical Fish, Villagers, and Cats), as well as its **health**. More importantly, certain mobs can reveal **hidden** information: studying a Horse reveals its **Speed** and **Jump Strength**, which can be invaluable for comparing mounts!

If you have **[Improved Polar Bears](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_polar_bear)** installed, the Polar Bear's current state and stored food meter are visible.

> **Note**: For datapack developers: This datapack provides a function tag `dc_spyglass_study:on_finish_study` where you can attach custom mob info.
