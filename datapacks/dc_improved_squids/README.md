# Improved Squids

> **Note**: *This datapack is part of the [Improved Mobs](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/wiki/Improved-Mobs) collection.*

**Improved Squids** enhances the Squid's ink ability so that it actually blinds players. When you damage a Squid underwater, its ink cloud applies **Blindness** for 10 seconds while it makes its getaway. This also disables the player's sprint-swimming temporarily, leaving the player more vulnerable to other dangers of the sea.

In addition to Blindness, Glow Squids also give players the **Glowing** effect!
