# Bug Stomp

**Bug Stomp** adds a simple mechanic to squash arthropods including **Spiders**, **Cave Spiders**, **Silverfish**, and **Endermites** by jumping on top of them! This deals high damage that kills most bugs in one hit, providing another way to get rid of pesky insects. You must be wearing **boots armor** to be able to squash foes.
