**Nightblood** is a sentient, unique, unbreakable, highly destructive sword inspired by . Based on [Nightblood](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nightblood) and other Shardblade-style weapons from [Brandon Sanderson's](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson) [Cosmere universe](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere), Nightblood is potentially the most powerful sword in existence. When unleashed, it can **obliterate any entity** with the slightest nick. Unlike its book counterpart, it is controlled with a ten-heartbeat activation similar to its Shardblade cousins.

Nightblood is **sheathed** by default. In this state, Nightblood is less powerful: it deals equal damage to an Iron Sword along with heavier knockback due to the weight of the blade.

While holding Nightblood, sneak for 10 seconds to **unleash** the sword. This awakens the sword, turning you into an unstoppable warrior. In this state, you have enhanced visibility, attack speed, movement speed, and can **destroy any creature utterly with a single hit**. (Yes, ANY creature.) However, Nightblood also **feeds on your XP at a progressively faster rate**, easily consuming 30 levels in under a minute! Should you run out of experience, it will consume on your spark of life, killing you instead! Sneak for 10 seconds to sheathe the sword again, but be waryâ€”the sword continues to drain your experience while sheathing! Attempting to drop or unequip Nightblood in any way only accelerates your quick and painful death, as it bonds to you while unleashed.

Creatures killed by Nightblood are **erased** from existence: they disappear into a puff of corrupted black smoke and **drop no items**. This occurs for players as well, and can even erase items when `keepInventory` is on. Although Nightblood is incredibly powerful, you do not gain drops nor experience from kills, which limits its usefulness.

## Throwing Nightblood

Nightblood can also be **embedded into the ground** when thrown, where it draws certain mobs to try to pick it up. However, it kills those it determines to be unworthy of wielding it. Most weaker hostile mobs that can wield a blade are drawn to the sword, and consumed if they get too close. Similarly **players below a certain XP threshold** are drawn to the blade and can be killed by it if they do not have sufficient levels. In this form, the blade does not kill instantly, but instead drains the victim's life over a few seconds before killing them.

This usage does not drain experience levels, and can be used at the wielder's own risk to deal with hostile mobs and other threats.

## Speech

> "Hello! Would you like to destroy some evil today?"

While sheathed, Nightblood speaks into the minds of those nearby, trying to tempt them to unsheathe the blade. These randomized speech lines change depending on the context, and may be different for each listener. When unleashed, Nightblood grows less coherent as its primal instincts take over.

## Known Bugs

Nightblood is a powerful sword, and no more than one copy of it should ever exist in a world. Attempts to wield more than one copy at a time can lead to ... undesirable consequences.
