# Nightblood

> "Hello! Would you like to destroy some evil today?"

**Nightblood** is a uniquely sentient, highly destructive sword inspired by [Brandon Sanderson's](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson) [Cosmere universe](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere). Based on a [sword of the same name](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nightblood), Nightblood has been Commanded to destroy evil—but what is evil? It'll trust the wielder's judgement.

Nightblood is **sheathed** by default. In this state, Nightblood is less powerful: it deals equal damage to an Iron Sword along with heavier knockback due to the weight of the blade. Nightblood can also be **embedded into the ground** when thrown, where it draws certain mobs to try to pick it up. Most hostile mobs are affected, if they have hands that can wield the sword, as well as **players below a certain XP threshold!**

While holding Nightblood, sneak for 10 seconds to **unleash** the sword. In this state, you have enhanced visibility, speed, jump strength, and can **destroy any creature in a single hit**. (Yes, ANY creature.) However, Nightblood also **drains your XP at a progressively faster rate**, easily consuming 30 levels in under a minute! Should you run out of experience, it will consume on your spark of life, killing you instead! Sneak for 10 seconds to sheathe the sword again, but be wary—the sword continues to drain your experience while sheathing! Attempting to drop or unequip Nightblood in any way only accelerates your quick and painful death, as it bonds to you while unleashed.

Creatures killed by Nightblood are **erased** from existence: they disappear into a puff of corrupted black smoke and **drop no items**. This occurs for players as well, and can even erase items when `keepInventory` is on. Although Nightblood is incredibly powerful, you do not gain drops nor experience from kills, which limits its usefulness.

## Speech

While sheathed, Nightblood speaks into the minds of those nearby, trying to tempt them to unsheathe the blade. These randomized speech lines change depending on the context, and may be different for each listener. When unleashed, Nightblood grows less coherent as its primal instincts take over.

## Known Bugs

Nightblood is a powerful sword, and no more than one copy of it should ever exist in a world. Attempts to wield more than one copy at a time can lead to ... undesirable consequences.
