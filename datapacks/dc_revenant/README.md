# Revenants

**Revenants** adds a new mini-boss to the game, the **Revenant**. The reanimated bones of an ancient soldier  trained in the art of war, the Revenant can seamlessly switch between different combat stances. Imbued with spectral power, it also encircles victim in **Darkness** every time it switches stances.

In its **archer stance**, the Revenant harries its foes with bone-chilling Slowness Arrows. The Revenant is **extra quick** in this stance, allowing them to close and maintain gaps with ease.

When enemies draw too close, the Revenant switches to its **sword stance**, where it uses an Iron Sword with deadly skill. In this stance, its powerful strikes **knock enemies back** great distances. However, it is much slower (though still faster than most Undead) and can be easily outpaced. If its target runs too far away, it switches back to its **archer stance** in pursuit.

When dropped below half health, the Revenant calls upon ghostly energy to adopt a formidable **sword and shield stance**. This third and final stance is slow, but very powerful: the Revenant can use its shield to **intercept all incoming projectiles**, making it effectively **immune to any kind of ranged attack**. The only sure way to defeat Revenants is to face them head on, blade against blade.
