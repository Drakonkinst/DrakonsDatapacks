Ever wanted to plant your shovel over some treasure on a deserted island? Or place a sword in a stone? How about leaving an axe in a tree stump? Imagine a battle-strewn field, with fallen warriors leaving behind their weapons after death.

**Tool Embed** makes dropped tool items turn into **decorative models** that **embed into the ground**! Theses embedded models never despawn and can be used to add a sense of character to your world.

Embedded models can only be **picked up while Sneaking**, allowing them to be used for decoration. If the block supporting the embedded tool is destroyed or it cannot find a surface to place itself, it reverts back to an item. 

Embedded models do not float, allowing them to be left at the bottom of the sea. In addition, embedded models are immune to Lava, Fire, and other hazards (though the item itself may not be).
