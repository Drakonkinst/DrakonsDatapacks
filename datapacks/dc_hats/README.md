# Hats

**Hats** allows you to wear any item on your head, for fun!

While holding any item, simply run `/trigger hat` to place the item on your head! This allows for unique (if impractical) headwear such as Glass blocks as a fishbowl hat, End Rods as a unicorn horn, or a Banner to show your colors.
