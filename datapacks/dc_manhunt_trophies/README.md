# Manhunt Trophies

**Manhunt Trophies** adds a set of collectible trophies that can be awarded for winning [Manhunts](https://github.com/Drakonkinst/DrakonsDatapacks/tree/master/datapacks/dc_manhunt_compass). There are separate trophy sets for hunters and speedrunners, with a spawnable Villager able to trade multiple lower-value trophies for higher-level ones.

This datapack is mainly useful for admins, who can run the functions in the datapack to give players items and spawn the trader.
